# farbenite-web

This is the web created for a (now dead) Twitter bot called `farbenite`. Its purpose was to tweet daily color palettes to inspire people and give some color into everybody's timeline. This page was done just as an informative entry point of its purpose, how it was created and a small versioning log.
